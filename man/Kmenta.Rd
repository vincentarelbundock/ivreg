\description{
These are partly contrived data from Kmenta (1986), constructed
to illustrate estimation of a simultaneous-equation econometric model. The data
are an annual time-series for the U.S. economy from 1922 to 1941. The values of the
exogenous variables D, and F, and A are real, while those of the endogenous
variables Q and P are simulated according to the linear simultaneous equation model 
fit in the examples.
